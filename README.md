# New Shipment Viewer

hey! i'm glad you're here :-)

## why?

the old one was a crusty hack on top of zach's warehouse base because it needed to exist (at that time there was no way to see what HQ sent you)

this one kinda maybe looks more like actual usable maintainable software

the constant "why do my high seas orders not show up in there?" -> "because it doesn't have that data because this was a 1-afternoon hackjob" got really irritating so i wrote something new data sources can actually be integrated into
